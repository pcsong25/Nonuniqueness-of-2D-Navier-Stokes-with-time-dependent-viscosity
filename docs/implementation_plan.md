# Implementation plan

## Goal

Build a new sparse-matrix finite-difference codebase that reproduces the verified baseline
workflow for the self-similar 2D Euler time-dependent-viscosity problem, while improving
efficiency and keeping validation explicit.

## Success criteria

The new implementation should ultimately provide:
- vortex/profile solution,
- first k eigenvalues,
- first k eigenfunctions,
- error / residual / diagnostic measures,
- preliminary debug visualizations,
- meaningful baseline-vs-nextgen validation and timing comparisons.

## Milestones

### M0. Baseline intake and repo-local fixes
Status: completed

Objectives:
- identify the active baseline workflow from `src/baseline/driver.py`,
- determine which baseline files are actually used,
- make minimal repo-local fixes so baseline code is runnable,
- summarize the mathematical/computational workflow.

Deliverables:
- updated `docs/progress_log.md`
- baseline dependency/workflow summary

### M1. Nextgen numerical foundations
Status: completed

Objectives:
- create `src/nextgen/` structure,
- implement grid/boundary/operator/diagnostic foundations,
- validate basic conventions and low-level building blocks.

Deliverables:
- foundation modules
- low-level tests

### M2. Poisson solver
Status: completed

Objectives:
- implement sparse Neumann Poisson solve,
- pin gauge consistently,
- validate boundary conventions and solver residuals.

Deliverables:
- `src/nextgen/poisson.py`
- tests for Neumann conventions / manufactured checks / gauge handling

### M3. Profile solver
Status: in progress / next

Objectives:
- implement the nonlinear self-similar profile solve on top of nextgen foundations,
- preserve baseline mathematical conventions,
- include robust Newton-type solve strategy and diagnostics,
- compare against baseline on reduced cases.

Required validation:
- unit/integration tests where appropriate,
- at least one simplified or manufactured check if feasible,
- at least one baseline comparison on a reduced case,
- runtime and discrepancy summary.

Deliverables:
- profile solver module(s)
- tests
- logged comparison results

### M4. Linearized operator assembly
Status: pending

Objectives:
- assemble the linearized operator around the computed profile,
- document sign conventions and normalization choices carefully,
- validate consistency against baseline logic.

Required validation:
- operator consistency checks,
- reduced-case comparisons,
- documented assumptions.

### M5. Eigensolver
Status: pending

Objectives:
- compute the first k eigenvalues/eigenfunctions,
- choose sparse eigensolver strategy appropriate for lowest modes,
- include normalization and residual diagnostics.

Required validation:
- eigenpair residual checks,
- stability under discretization/domain refinement,
- baseline comparison on shared cases.

### M6. Benchmarking and output refinement
Status: pending

Objectives:
- benchmark nextgen vs baseline,
- improve debug plots and numerical summaries,
- document where nextgen wins and where it does not.

Required validation:
- timing tables,
- accuracy comparisons,
- parameter-sensitivity summaries.

## Operating rules

- One milestone at a time.
- Commit after each accepted milestone.
- Do not rely on chat history as the only project memory.
- Use `docs/progress_log.md` for narrative status and `experiments/registry.csv` for run-by-run records.

## Current recommended next milestone

M3. Profile solver only.
Do not implement the eigensolver yet.
